        This capstone project aims to design and implement a digital learning management system, limited to BSIT students in ICCT COLLEGES. The system goals include increasing flexibility for learners who might find it difficult to attend physical classes due to health issues or family obligations and it is also a big help in reducing the students’ transportation costs. Also, instructors can maintain and update their teaching materials more easily as needed. Accessing study materials at any time and improving students' abilities and skills are both made possible by digital learning.
